## Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Project Title:** OpenWRT Log Analyzer for AI Processing  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 04/08/2025  

---

### 1. Introduction

#### 1.1 Purpose
The **OpenWRT Log Analyzer** is a software application designed to run as a dedicated service, potentially on a separate host due to the computational demands of AI processing, which may be CPU-intensive (e.g., for AI analysis) and memory-intensive (e.g., for handling large log volumes). It receives raw OpenWRT logs from sources like the Network_Monitor application, converts them into structured formats (e.g., JSON, CSV) suitable for AI processing, and provides endpoints for configuration and potentially retrieving analysis results. By parsing, transforming, and analyzing log data, the application enables AI algorithms to assess network performance, detect anomalies, and identify security threats. It also provides a mechanism to send configuration commands back to log sources. This solution addresses the challenge of leveraging unstructured log data for automated, AI-driven network management. Potential hardware considerations include multi-core processors and sufficient RAM (e.g., 16GB+) to ensure efficient processing.

#### 1.2 Target Audience
- **Primary Users:** Network administrators, data scientists, and IT professionals who need to analyze OpenWRT logs for network monitoring, security, or performance optimization.  
- **Secondary Users:** Home users seeking a simplified way to monitor their network for suspicious activities or performance issues, with minimal technical expertise required.  
While the application provides advanced features for technical users, it also offers a simplified interface for home users to ensure accessibility.

### 2. Key Features

The application must include the following core features to meet its objectives:

#### 2.1 Log Parsing
- **Requirement:** The application shall parse OpenWRT logs using text processing techniques (e.g., regular expressions) to identify and extract relevant log lines.  
- **Details:** It must handle various log formats generated by OpenWRT, including logs from daemons like `hostapd`, `dnsmasq`, and firewall events. The parsing logic must accommodate variations in log formats across different OpenWRT versions and custom configurations.

#### 2.2 Data Extraction
- **Requirement:** The application shall receive log data from external applications like Network_Monitor via a dedicated ingestion endpoint, preferably using a message queue protocol (e.g., MQTT, Redis Streams) to ensure scalability and decoupling. It shall extract critical data points from the logs, including but not limited to:  
  - Timestamps  
  - IP addresses (source and destination)  
  - Event types (e.g., connection attempts, errors)  
  - Error codes  
  - Device identifiers (e.g., MAC addresses)  
- **Details:** The application shall subscribe to a message queue to receive log data pushed by external applications. The extraction process must be configurable to allow users to specify which data points to capture.

#### 2.3 Data Transformation
- **Requirement:** The application shall transform the extracted data into structured formats such as JSON or CSV.  
- **Details:** The output must be clearly labeled and organized to facilitate easy ingestion by AI algorithms. In addition, the application should support output formats optimized for big data processing, such as Parquet, to enhance efficiency for large-scale AI analysis.

#### 2.4 AI Analysis Modularity
- **Requirement:** The application architecture shall be modular, allowing different AI analysis components (e.g., for performance, security, anomaly detection) to be developed and integrated as plugins or distinct modules.  
- **Details:** A clear interface shall be defined for how analysis modules receive structured data and produce results or insights. The specific AI analyses for the initial version are TBD, but the infrastructure must support future expansion. Potential AI modules may include anomaly detection for security threats, performance optimization for network traffic, and predictive maintenance for hardware failures.

#### 2.5 Scalability
- **Requirement:** The application shall efficiently process large volumes of logs. On dedicated server hardware (refer to Sec 4.4), the target processing rate is at least 10,000 log lines per second, aggregating data potentially from up to 100 routers.
- **Details:** Processing speed on resource-constrained devices (e.g., routers) will be lower and dependent on available resources. The system must handle logs from both small-scale (e.g., home networks) and large-scale deployments without significant performance degradation relative to the host hardware.

#### 2.6 Configurability
- **Requirement:** The application shall allow users to customize data extraction rules, AI module settings, and output structures via configuration files or a dedicated web-based user interface hosted by the Log-Analyzer service itself.
- **Details:** Users should be able to define which fields to extract, enable/disable specific AI analyses, and how to map them in the output format. For v1.0, configuration settings shall be stored persistently primarily using structured configuration files (e.g., YAML, JSON). Database storage may be considered for future enhancements.

#### 2.7 Error Handling
- **Requirement:** The application shall robustly manage inconsistencies or malformed log lines.
- **Details:** It must log errors gracefully (refer to Sec 4.6) without crashing and provide options to skip or flag problematic entries. For v1.0, critical system errors should trigger alerts via the monitoring system; direct email alerting can be considered as a future enhancement or require explicit SMTP configuration.

#### 2.8 Performance Optimization
- **Requirement:** The application shall be optimized for high performance, using efficient parsing, parallel processing, and minimal resource overhead.  
- **Details:** While optimized for dedicated servers, the application should also run efficiently on higher-end routers with at least 1GB RAM and a multi-core CPU.

#### 2.9 Command Output
- **Requirement:** The application shall provide a mechanism for analyzed results or AI-driven decisions to trigger commands intended for the original OpenWRT devices.  
- **Details:** These commands should be formatted according to OpenWRT's UCI standard. The delivery mechanism should allow consumers (like Network_Monitor) to subscribe to command events (e.g., via the message queue or a dedicated API endpoint). Commands must be encrypted and authenticated to ensure only authorized systems can send or receive them. The application shall validate commands against a predefined allowlist.
